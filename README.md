Sample Output of the code:

This repo contains code to train a Neural Network on the [American Sign Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) on Kaggle.

The training notebook can be found in the **training** folder. 

There is also an [blog for training the model](https://jimmiemunyi.github.io/blog/tutorial/2021/01/20/Sign-Language-Classification-with-Deep-Learning.html) and one for [making the inference app](https://jimmiemunyi.github.io/blog/tutorial/2021/01/21/Sign-Language-Inference-with-WebCam.html).

To run inference, use the **webcam_inference.py** file. Make you sure you replicate the virtual enviromnemt and install all requirements. Recommended way is to use conda. I provide the conda file requirements.txt for this purpose
